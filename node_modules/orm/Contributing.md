## Contributing

### Issues

Try to be the most specific possible. Give node version, database driver and orm version. Give an example,
that will help other people to try and replicate your problem.

### Pull Requests

They are always welcome, but they must pass all the tests. If adding a new feature, don't forget about adding
it to documentation (Readme.md) and add tests for it. If you need help preparing a local clone for testing
just ask and we'll help you.
